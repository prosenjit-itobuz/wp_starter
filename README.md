* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A helpful 404 template.
* A sample custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php` that can be activated by uncommenting one line in `functions.php` and adding the code snippet found in the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.
* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in `inc/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.
* Bootstrap included in `css/vendor.css`
* Navbar css included in `style.css`
* No extra css included.


Getting Started
---------------


* Search for `'wpautomate'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.
* Search for `wpautomate_` to capture all the function names.
* Search for `Text Domain: wpautomate` in style.css.
* Search for `wpautomate-` to capture prefixed handles.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
